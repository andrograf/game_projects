    "The night came already when young man finished his classes." 
    "It was a tiresome day. Not just because it was his first day, but he needed to listen to his lector's preaching about his late arrival,"
    "then he had to do extra effort on every class to know his presence, but still he got angry glances from the teachers and the students as well."
    "It was not a great way for doing a freat impression."

    "Beside a noisy person at one of the common lessons, he coudn't think out anyone"
    "As he was deep in his thoughts, he missed a turn and he found himself in a closed allay. The lights were barely enough to see the road."

    "When he turned his head toward the condescending and derisory voice, the scene in front of him made him speachless."
    "A scary group of men were standing there and slowly, they started to circle him."
    "He was in a big trouble and even if he never feared of the confrontations with people with number advantage, there were always someone nearby who stepped in before a fight could start."
    "This time it's else. They were at least 15 against him, who was completly alone in a dark, freaky alloy who knows which part of the city."
    "Usually nobody noticed him, but when there are no crowd, just you, suddenly you bacame the center of the attention. This realization made the youngster tremble."
    
    youngman "'If you don't show you fear, they will stand back. Can't let them see any weakness.' - the blue head told himself. - 'Just like the animals. You need being confident.'"
    youngman "I'm an adult man. Thank you, but I can find the right road by myself. If you could step away...."

    "The gang looked around themselves, then started laughing. It was clear they do not plan any good."
    "A lean, tall man with a nasty smile stepped out from the crowd. The laughing stopped for once. It seemed he's a kind of boss, based on his expensive suit, and the intimitating effect on his peers."


    badGuy2 "Step away Haizaki. I'll handle this business. This guy seems very interesting."

    "The hard hit made the boy dizzy. The man in front of him was not a joke."
    "By instinc, he closed his eyes. When he reopen them again, he stared into the scary man dark, soulness globes. He felt a chill over his body."

    badGuy2 "What about we would know each other a little better? Hmm?"

    youngman "Khh?!"

    "The man pushed him onto the ground with great force. When he tried to stand up, another member kicked him back. The gengsters formed a closed circle."
    "There was no escape from here."

    badGuy2 "Oh, nooo~~ Do you want to go already? We just started to get close to each other. "
    "Another round laugh went around the crowd. It seemed the other people were watching the scene in front of them with so enjoyment, as if he was just an actor in a funny show."

    "Suddenly, a blade sinister sound cought the fallen boy's ears."

    youngman "W-what do you want from me?"

    "He could not keep away the fear from his voise anymore. Where there are weapons, someone will definitely injure. And that someone will be him soon."
    "The boss-like figure had a more bigger smile. Definitely heard that small mistake in his sentence."

    badGuy2 "Don't worry, don't worry ~ "

    "The guy slowly approched him. Like a predator who playes with his prey before eat it in a grotesque way. "

    "Before he could react, two men from the crowd grabbed his arms and hold him still. When he started kicking them, the 'Haizaki' named man put another knife to his throat."


    haizaki "Try to move or scream and you're dead. Got ya'?"

    "The always pale boy became now as white as a real ghost. He nodded nervously."

    youngman "'Please someone, Anyone...help' - he prayed in  his head desperately. He just wanted a simple life, with simple things. Now it was doubtious if he will see another morning at all."

    "When the boss neared him, he could only watch with tearing up eyes as his shirt was cut apart. The cold nightly wind made him tremble as his bare chest was exposed to it."
    "However, when the man moved his hands lower to his belt, the surviving reflex kicked in again."

    "His crimson red hair and the matching red eyes looked at the boy on the ground, straigth into the boys sky blue ones. It was a mystery what the strange man thought."
